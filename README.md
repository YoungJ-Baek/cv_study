# cv_study

Repository for studying computer vision, especially OpenCV, PCL.

## To do

- [ ] Convert code from calibrating whole image to calibrating only key points
  - [ ] Feature matching first, and undistort key points
  - [ ] Calculate R, t and rectify(perspective transform) undistorted key points
  - [ ] Plot obtained key points on the rectified images
- [ ] Convert code from Python to C++
- [ ] Refactoring code available for ROS2
